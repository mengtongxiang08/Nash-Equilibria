This project uses Python simulations to show how Nash equilibria can emerge over time through repeated gameplay.
Players repeatedly play games, learn from their outcomes, and slowly adjust their strategies. Over many games, their behavior converges to a Nash equilibrium.

Run the program from the command line:
python main.py pd.txt
Where pd.txt is a payoff matrix file (e.g., Prisoner’s Dilemma).

This project supports the following games:
Prisoner’s Dilemma (1 Nash equilibrium)
Stag and Hare (2 Nash equilibria)
Battle of the Sexes (2 Nash equilibria)
Rock-Paper-Scissors (mixed strategy Nash equilibrium)
